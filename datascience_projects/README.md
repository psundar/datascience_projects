## Data Science Projects
This directory is a repository of different data science projects that I'm doing in my data science learning journey. 
  
### The Iris Data Set  
  
For the simplest of example, I took the Iris data set already in the scikit learn library to learn the cycle of a classification problem 
from learning about data to accuracy of the model. 
  
### The Global Temperature Data 
The second project is an attempt of utilizing global climate change data and global forest cover data from world bank and global land 
temperature data from Berkeley to see if they could be used to somehow measure which countries are affected more by climate change 
and how much are they taking steps through afforestation and reduce their carbon foot print. This one is a long project and experimental. 

For first step, this project attempts to clean individual data and do exploratory data analysis before attempting to combine them for 
data modeling.
